# Container Intro


Containers refer to a lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient unit of software that puts together code and all its dependencies so one can run an application/service.

Virtual machine (VM)s virtualize the underlying hardware so that multiple operating system (OS) instances can run on that hardware. Each VM runs an OS and has access to virtualized resources representing the underlying hardware. On the other hand, a container virtualizes the underlying OS and causes the containerized app to perceive that it has the OS—including CPU, memory, file storage, and network connections—all to itself. Besides, containers share the host OS, so they do not need to boot an OS. So contenarized applications can start much faster.

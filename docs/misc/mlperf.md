# MLPerf

MLPerf is an open, industry-standard benchmark suite for measuring machine learning performance.
Itâ€™s maintained by the MLCommons consortium (which includes NVIDIA, Google, Intel, and others). MLPerf is primarily categorized by two major types of ML processes: training and inference. There are also specialized benchmarks for specific hardware and workloads. Original documents describing MLPerf can be found here: [MLPerf Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01500) and [MLPerf Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02549). Those are interesting to understand some of the key motivations behind these benchmarks, including the uniqueness of ML/DL workloads w.r.t. benchmarking.


MLPerf evaluates systems on standardized ML workloads across multiple domains,
including:

- Image classification (e.g., ResNet-50)
- Object detection (e.g., SSD, Mask R-CNN)
- Language modeling (e.g., BERT)
- Recommendation systems (e.g., DLRM)
- Speech recognition (e.g., RNN-T)


Full list for training can be found [here](https://mlcommons.org/benchmarks/training/) and inference can be found [here](https://mlcommons.org/benchmarks/inference-datacenter/).

One can use MLPerf results to: (i) Compare hardware (e.g., GPU vs CPU); (ii) Tune software stacks (CUDA, PyTorch, TensorFlow); and (iii) Validate scaling behavior or deployment efficiency.


## Testing on a single VM

### Training

Example: Single Stage Detector.

In this example we assume we have a VM in azure with SKU `Standard_NC40ads_H100_v5` and image `almalinux:almalinux-hpc:8_10-hpc-gen2:latest`. Once machine is provisioned, check if gpus+cuda is detected via: `nvidia-smi`.

```bash title="prepmlperf"
--8<-- "docs/misc/mlperf/single_stage_detector.sh"
```

Once run script is started, output should be:

```
Epoch: [0]  [    0/36571]  eta: 1 day, 20:19:44  lr: 0.000000  loss: 2.2699 (2.2699)  classification: 1.5590 (1.5590)  bbox_reg

 0.7024 (0.7151)  time: 0.4384  data: 0.0004  max mem: 52125

```


## Multiple VMs

Similar to single VM but a cluster needs to be provision and parameters related
to SLURM need to be adjusted. See details

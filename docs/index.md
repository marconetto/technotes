# TechNotes

I have a few code samples, walkthroughs, projects, experiments, links, and
general notes that have been spread into multiple git repositories. I needed
some more structure to see all this content myself, which can also be helpful to
someone else. So I've decided to create this repo to serve as a hub for this
content. Things here are not up-to-date, have no warranty, etc...

Some topics here are:
- HPC
- Containers
- Analytics / ML
- Scripts / linux
- Distributed systems in general
- Projects
